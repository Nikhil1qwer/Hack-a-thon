Introduction: To implement a Data Structure to simulate Traffic flow & congestion on a road network.

Goal: Simulation of Traffic flow and congestion on a road network.
      Tracking vehicle's speed, route, Vehicle ID and Optimization of
      traffic signals at intersection, and provide real-time updates on traffic conditions.

Intuition WalkThrough:

    The Traffic Management System starts with a kickstart Menu that displays the basic functionalities of the system
    such as Register Vehicle, Optimize Traffic Signals at intersection and Display the queried data

    It uses 

Contribution: 
        1. Optimizes the traffic conditions on different routes.
        2. While keeping track of vehicle details such as Vehicle ID, route and speed.
        3. Useful for maintaining the stable traffic flow.
        4. Provides the structured data for any Queries.
