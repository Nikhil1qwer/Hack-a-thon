Title: Traffic Management System in C

Introduction:
            The Traffic Management System is a C program designed to manage and optimize traffic flow.
            It provides functionalities for registering vehicles, optimizing traffic signals,
            monitoring real-time traffic conditions, and displaying vehicle data.

Code Overview:
         The code consists of several functions and data structures to facilitate traffic management:

Data Structures:

Vehicle structure: 
             Represents a vehicle with attributes / values like ID, route, and speed.

list:
     A dynamic array of pointers to Vehicle structures, used to store vehicle data.

RutF and RutA: 
     Arrays to store route frequency and speed accumulation respectively.

Main Functionality:

Registration of Vehicles:
                     Users can register vehicles by providing their ID, route, and speed. The program dynamically allocates memory to store vehicle data.

Optimizing Traffic Signals: 
                     Traffic signals can be optimized based on either route or intersection. 
                     The program sorts vehicles based on route frequency and speed, providing an optimized flow.

Monitoring Real-Time Traffic Conditions:
                     Users can view real-time traffic conditions, including route-wise traffic density and average speeds.

Displaying Vehicle Data:
                     Users have the option to display all registered vehicle data.

Additional Features:
    Color-coded Output: The program utilizes ANSI escape codes to colorize output for better visualization.
    Error Handling: Error messages are displayed for invalid commands.
    User Interaction: Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface.

Code Analysis:

Time Complexity:
        The overall time complexity of the system depends on the user's interactions with the program.
        The core functionalities, such as vehicle registration, traffic signal optimization, and data display, have efficient time complexities.

Space Complexity: 
        The space complexity is primarily determined by the storage of vehicle data and route statistics. 
        The system efficiently manages memory allocation, and the space complexity remains reasonable.
